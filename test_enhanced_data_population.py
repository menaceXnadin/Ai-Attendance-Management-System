ENHANCED FACE RECOGNITION DATA POPULATION TEST
===============================================

Test the enhanced face recognition system to ensure new records
populate all 14 attendance_records fields correctly.

This addresses the user's key requirement:
"TONS OF COLUMNS IN THE ATTENDACE RECORD TABLE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THAT ALL THE NECESSARY DATA ARE BING SENT THAT NEED S WHILE DOINF SELF RECOGNITION"
