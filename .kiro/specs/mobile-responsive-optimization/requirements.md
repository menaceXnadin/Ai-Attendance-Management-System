# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Attendance Management System currently provides comprehensive functionality for both admin and student users through a web-based interface. However, analysis of the current system reveals that while the UI has been enhanced with modern components and dark themes, there are significant opportunities to improve mobile responsiveness and cross-device compatibility. Given that attendance marking often happens on mobile devices and students frequently access the system via smartphones, optimizing the mobile experience is critical for user adoption and system effectiveness.

This feature focuses on creating a fully responsive, mobile-first experience that maintains all existing functionality while providing an optimized interface for smartphones and tablets.
